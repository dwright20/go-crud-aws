# Go, CRUD, AWS
Go, CRUD, AWS is a project I am working on to get a better understanding of Go(Golang), CRUD functionality, and HTTP while hosting it all on AWS. The system works as a storage system for a user's game results in Apex Legends, Fortnite, and Heroes of the Storm.  The user can retrieve their uploaded results and produce a table for each specific game.
